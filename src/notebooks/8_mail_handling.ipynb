    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice (Data Scientist): Hey team, we've been tasked with building a fraud detection system for online transactions. Our dataset contains transaction details like amount, location, device type, and whether the transaction was fraudulent. Where should we start?\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Bob (ML Engineer): First, we need to explore the dataset. Let’s check for missing values, outliers, and class imbalance. Fraudulent transactions are typically much fewer than non-fraudulent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: Good point. If the dataset is highly imbalanced, we might need techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Charlie (Business Analyst): Fraudulent transactions usually have patterns, like sudden high-value transactions from new devices or unusual locations. Feature engineering will be crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: Exactly! We can create new features, such as transaction frequency per user, time since last transaction, and location anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Bob: What model should we use? A simple Logistic Regression might work, but we could try Random Forest, XGBoost, or a Neural Network for better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: XGBoost is great for tabular data. But let’s first build a baseline model with Logistic Regression and then optimize with XGBoost or LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Charlie: How do we evaluate the model? Accuracy might not be enough since fraud cases are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: Right! Precision, Recall, and the F1-score are more important. We don’t want too many false negatives (missed fraud cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Bob: Should we use a real-time detection system? If so, latency is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: Yes, if we deploy it, the model should be lightweight and fast, maybe using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX.\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Charlie: We should also ensure explainability. Banks and customers will want to know why a transaction was flagged as fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: True! We can use SHAP values or LIME to explain model decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "👨‍💻 Bob: Let’s start with EDA, feature engineering, and a baseline model. Then, we can iterate and optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍💻 Alice: Sounds like a plan! Let’s get to work. 🚀\n",
