The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al.[4] It is considered a foundational[5] paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT.[6][7] At the time, [...] ^ a b c d e f Vaswani, Ashish; Shazeer, Noam; Parmar, Niki; Uszkoreit, Jakob; Jones, Llion; Gomez, Aidan N; Kaiser, Łukasz; Polosukhin, Illia (December 2017). \"Attention is All you Need\".

Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. Vol.\\xa030. Curran Associates, Inc. arXiv:1706.03762. [...] In 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance.[1] This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads',\n",

The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in 6 the input sequence centered around the respective output position.
